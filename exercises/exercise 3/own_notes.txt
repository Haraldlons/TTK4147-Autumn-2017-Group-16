Exercise 3 - Own notes
============================

Butterfl Real-Time Tester(BRTT). 
BRTT applikasjon som kjører på en AVR butterfly som sjekker responstiden til et sanntidssystem. 

AVR32 UC3 connected to PC and JTAG som beskrevet i "Getting started guide".

Green button AVR Studio to build test application, program the card and run the application.

Program starts -> LED blinking every second. 
Blue play and pause button, to start debugging.
	Step through the code one line at the time, add breakpoints.

1.2 Serial Debugging.
printf() printer gjennom USB-to-serial device. 
Use "Termite serial console"

Start "Termite program" WHILE AVR32 is running. 
	Click settings, select last port(maybe COM 3)
	aud rate of 115200
	8 data bits
	1 stop bits
	none parity and flow control
	Click "ok" 
	and then on the button on the top left of the main window to connect. 
	Should print "tick" every second.
	If not reconnect usb-cabel.
	
	Trick
		reprogram or restart avr32 while the termite program is "waiting for port".
		
	Remember that "printf()" should be avoided in real-time code, as it is slow and unpredictable.
	
1.3 Description of the project

2.3 Busy wait

BRTT signaliserer AVR32 ved å sette TEST A pin lav. AVR32 skal så sette så fort som mulig, RESPONSE A pin lav.
